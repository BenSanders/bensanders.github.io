        <title>The Sims 4 Laundry Day</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;videoContent&quot;&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
    So, it&#39;s finally here or at least tomorrow it will finally be here. The Sims
    4 Laundry Day stuff pack. Perhaps the first stuff pack I can remember I have
    been excited about. I think the main reason I&#39;m excited about this stuff pack
    is that it is the first time the community has voted on what the next stuff
    pack will be. Maybe if this pack ends up being a success it will lead them to
    work with the community in future TS4 content.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&#39;m a simmer, that&#39;s one thing that is for sure. I&#39;ve been playing The Sims
    franchise since my dad bought the first game for my mom. I can remember
    spending hours as a kid playing the game. It&#39;s one of the main game franchises
    that shaped my childhood. Perhaps I&#39;ll do a video or a blog post on games I
    played as a child in the future.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So, what are my thoughts on the actual stuff pack getting ready to come out?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I love it! The reason being that back when laundry was first introduced back
    in The Sims 3: Ambitions I loved watching my Sims do laundry. There&#39;s just
    something about laundry, and seasons, that adds more realism to the game.
    It makes it easier for me to put myself in that world.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    There&#39;s also the trailer they made for the stuff pack which I can tell The
    Sims team was having fun. Although considering the topic of the stuff pack.
    I&#39;m surprised they were able to make the trailer as exciting as it is.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&#39;m looking forward to putting another 300 hours into the game or, you know,
    something like that. I&#39;ll emerge on the other side not knowing what&#39;s going
    on in the real world. Perhaps even mainly speaking in Similish.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Let me know in the comments if you are looking forward to The Sims 4: Laundry
    Day Stuff! I look forward to your thoughts. You can follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thebensanders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and

    day. Happy Siming.
  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Read More.</title>
        <description>&lt;!-- &lt;section class=&quot;photoset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/read-more-small.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-featured-image&quot; alt=&quot;Google Drive Logo&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt; --&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
    I can remember the very first book I read all the way through. It was &quot;Harry
    Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone&quot;.  I remember the day I decided to start
    reading the Harry Potter Series. It was right after I had seen the first film.
    I guess I wanted to be immersed in the Harry Potter universe even more.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Ever since those days though I haven&#39;t really read a whole lot other than
    the occasional blog posts. Which, I suppose, is still reading and you can
    still get the same benefits as reading a book. I just haven&#39;t taken the time
    to just sit back, relax, and take a journey with a nice book in a while.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You see since the start of 2018 I have been thinking about reading more.
    Well, not just reading more but writing more as well. I am aware that I wrote
    several posts in 2017. I just want to try to write much longer, more meaningful
    blog posts. Sort of like short stories but on the web. Carefully crafting a
    story that would take the reader on an adventure with each and every word.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I want to try to take my writing to the next level by taking the reader on a
    journey in their own mind. Sort of the way a good book does when you sit down
    to read it. Like how you start imagining what that world would be like to
    live in.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&#39;m going to stray a little here to say that I have been trying to find my
    niche on YouTube. I had recently found the BookTube community which seems to
    go with what I want to do in terms of reading and writing more. Hell, I might
    even actually write a novel one day. Wouldn&#39;t that be great?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So, where is this all going, I hear you ask yourself.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Well, here in 2018 I would honestly like to read more. Starting with Emma
    Blackery&#39;s &quot;Feel Good 101&quot;. I don&#39;t like setting a certain number but I&#39;m
    going to say I&#39;d like to read 20 books in 2018. Mostly books I already own
    which include: Egghead and The Fault in Our Stars.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Why Read Though?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Some people might say something about how you can get the same relaxation
    from watching TV or a YouTube video. The problem with that thinking though
    is that it still requires you to stare at a screen. I love the idea that
    reading allows you to put away your computer and phone for a small, to large,
    amount of time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    While you can read on, say an iPad, you&#39;ve still got the notifications
    coming through interrupting your reading. I want to read because it&#39;s a way
    to fully escape the world into a whole different one. Even reading non-fiction
    books can help you escape. It can conjure up what it must have been like to live
    in the times that book is talking about.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I like the way that Paul Stamatiou worded it on his
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulstamatiou.com/reading-more-kindle-oasis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &quot;Reading forces you to go one step further and not even let your mind wander
    a bit. If it does, you&#39;re punished by having to read the paragraph or page
    over again to understand what’s happening&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    That&#39;s very true I can attest to have been reading a book and my mind started
    wondering about something else. Then next thing I knew I was lost and didn&#39;t
    know where I had left off.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Reading isn&#39;t just about relaxing though it also allows you to see things
    from a different perspective. If you are set in your beliefs on one thing
    reading can give you a new perspective on those beliefs. You may or may not
    change what you personally believe but at least you have a better understanding
    of someone else&#39;s point-of-view.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;What to read?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    As I&#39;ve mentioned above I&#39;m starting out with Emma Blackery&#39;s book since
    that is the most recent book I bought. I do have several books in mind that
    I have been meaning to read myself. One book is &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; by Walter Isaacson.
    I will also be keeping an eye on Bill Gate&#39;s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/&quot;
    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gatesnotes&lt;/a&gt;, blog for ideas on
    books to read.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Thankfully, as mentioned previously, I found the
    &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=booktube&quot;&gt;BookTube community&lt;/a&gt; which
    led me to make a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76373017-ben-sanders&quot;&gt;Goodreads account&lt;/a&gt;.
    So, that&#39;s another place I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find great books to read. Really,
    there should be no excuse for me not to read 20 books in 2018.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    My final thoughts are that I&#39;m hoping I can actually read 20, or more, books
    in 2018. I&#39;m sure it will lead to me having a greater knowledge of the world
    and ultimately help improve my writing. Who knows? Perhaps by November of this
    year, I will actually participate in NaNoWriMo and have a published novel. :)
  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>National Novel Writing Month</title>
        <description>&lt;!-- &lt;section class=&quot;photoset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/NaNoWriMo_small.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-featured-image&quot; alt=&quot;Google Drive Logo&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt; --&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was listening to Not Too Deep with Grace Helbig and it was mentioned that
  November is National Novel Writing Month. My first thought was that I should blog about it. (lol)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Seriously though I have thought about writing a novel in the past.
  As I&#39;m sure almost every single person in the world has thought about doing.
  I think I&#39;ll stick to writing more on my blog to help work on my writing and storytelling skills.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I would imagine that difference between writing a novel and a blog post would
  be that you can&#39;t just have short paragraphs. I don&#39;t know, maybe you can.
  In writing, there are certain rules you should follow but I imagine if you can
  tell a compelling story. You can write however you want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As with any creative skill, however, it just takes practice to get better at.
  You just have to pick a skill you feel you would enjoy and just do it.
  You will suck at first but eventually, if you keep at it you will find your own style.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The worst thing for any writer is a blank page and there are plenty of remedies
to cure that problem. One of the main ones that many English college professors
will have you do is just write. Write about things and don&#39;t worry about grammar
or spelling. You can always edit it for grammar letter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks as always for taking the time to read my blog posts. I&#39;m going to try to
post more during November and onwards. I just never really had much that I felt
I could add to the blogosphere. Hopefully, this post does add something and I
would love to hear from you, dear reader, in the comments below. :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PS: After I copy and pasted these &quot;paragraphs&quot; into Atom the article seemed a lot shorter then it did in Grammarly.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Reasons To Upload Your Resume To Google Drive</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So, you&#39;re out of school or are almost out and you are looking for a job?
  You&#39;ve got your resume in hand or I should say in PDF form on your computer.
  You could upload it every time you send an email to a potential job or, and I
  suppose this only works if you use Gmail, you could upload it to Google Drive.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Recently I had applied for a job and I went to upload my resume to send to
  them and I had this thought about importing it from Google Drive. For some
  reason, all the times I had sent applications in I hadn&#39;t thought about doing
  this. I guess it&#39;s just me being stuck in the past so to speak. After I had
  sent the email I did think about the ease of which it would be to update my
  resume that company has now. If I update that one then it would just update
  for them since I basically sent them a link and allowed them to view it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So, my 5 reasons for uploading your resume to Google Drive and I suppose, as
  mentioned, this only applies if you use Gmail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;ul class=&quot;in-post-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1. Ease of Editability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2. Literally, only one copy is needed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3. &quot;The Cloud&quot; allows for access on any device&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4. Importing is easy from inside Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;5. Super convenient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Ease of Editability is as I mentioned above just the fact that you can edit the
  one file and have it update for all possible jobs. So, if you found a mistake
  when you sent the email you can quickly update it and have it reflected
  immediately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What I mean by &quot;literally, only one copy is needed&quot; is just as it sounds.
  You only need one copy since it&#39;s online in Google Drive you don&#39;t have to
  worry about resaving a Word Document as a PDF anymore. Just send the Google
  Drive Document, or whatever they call it.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &quot;The Cloud&quot;, which is a word I sort of hate since it simplifies the web a
  little too much but that&#39;s the buzz word that&#39;s been chosen. Either way
  &quot;The Cloud&quot; allows for you to view your resume, or any other document, on any
  device that has the app. So, if you need to show your resume to someone in a
  pinch just get your phone out and show them. You can even edit it from your
  phone, tablet, what have you.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Importing it from inside of Gmail is easy by just hitting the Drive icon and
  selecting your file. I would say it couldn&#39;t be any easier.
  I&#39;ll just include this last one in this paragraph. The last one being that
  it&#39;s just super convenient. Super convenient for really all the above points
  I mentioned.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thanks for taking the time to read this post and be sure to share it if you
  want to and comment below with your thoughts. :)

  Until Next Time,

        <title>Using Font Awesome In 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It has come to my attention that I should move into the new age so to speak of
  web development. I managed to teach myself SASS and get better with GIT, ha get,
  all jokes aside I need to keep my skills up. So, over the next few days, weeks
  and even months I&#39;ll be implementing &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; into my site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;ve always had trouble with things like the Hamburger menu, I guess because I
  always tried using an image for it. You know instead of using a CSS Icon Set.
  I&#39;ll also be trying to blog the experience more so I can get some actual
  content on this site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;ve already started filling out my &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://bensanders.me/portfolio&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.
  Although it&#39;s mostly just
  designs that I made up in Photoshop. I&#39;ve also popped open Illustrator to make
  some logos but I don&#39;t feel they are that great to share yet. I mostly just
  keep trying to slog away to keep busy on something creative.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I do still run my &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-youtube-play&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://youtube.com/thebensanders&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;
  channel as well where I upload vlogs and short
  Overwatch clips. I have already uploaded more videos this year than all of
  last year put together and depending on if the Dragon Con trip works out I&#39;ll
  have that on my channel. Along with plenty of photos from the Con on this site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Whatever happens, the next 5 and a half months thank you for taking the time
  to read this little update post. That all it seems I ever do on this site
  anymore. (lol)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Until Next Time, peace!&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Working Online and Where To Start</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now I have tried many different opportunities for working from home to no avail.
  However, this one finally worked or at least is working for now. I mean we never
  know what could happen tomorrow but either way, I am loving the freedom the job provides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It&#39;s not easy money either, you still have to work for it. How it works is you
  claim projects, type out exactly what you hear the best you can and submit them.
  Most of the time the audio can be a bit tricky to hear but I think that&#39;s the most
  rewarding part of it. I mean, imagine this, you are working on some audio and
  you finally are able to make out something. Would you feel a sense of satisfaction from that?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I am of course talking about working with Rev, the transcription company.
  Which so far has been a great work-from-home opportunity. As mentioned above it
  is not easy money but I can pick when and where I want to work. There is no set
  schedule and I get to work whenever I need money really.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There are a lot of ways to make money online though nowadays. You can set up an
  Etsy shop, you can sell your illustrations or maybe stream and people can donate
  to you. Though that last one is maybe more related if you have an already established
  brand and people feel they know you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Working from home is essentially you running your own business. So, if you treat
  it like you&#39;re a business owner that you are then find something that you love doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I would say the best way to make money online is to find something you would do
  for free and charge for it. The idea being that if it&#39;s something you&#39;d be doing
  for free you are probably good at it. At least good enough to garner some sort
  of eyeballs on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this being said to leave off this post I would like to say I am planning on
starting a podcast. I am not quite sure yet on the title but I have been wanting
to do a podcast for a while. So keep an eye on my twitter for more information on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Thoughts on The Red Pill Documentary</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;storyContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I recently watched a video from Armoured Skeptic about a documentary called
  The Red Pill. Which then prompted me to go and actually watch the film.
  I have not really been a fan of the men&#39;s rights movement or the feminist
  movement for that matter.  I sure as hell don&#39;t like the movement called MGTOW.
  However, the film did give me a nice, fresh, view on the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You see both sides do make valid points. I understand that with anything there
  is always going to be a radical sub-group. For example, the MGTOW which stands
  for Men Going Their Own Way. Which to me sounds like men who don&#39;t even want to
  try and solve the problems between the genders. Like they are too scared to solve
  the problems and instead hang a &quot;No Girls Allowed&quot; sign up in protest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The film does show off both the best and the worst of each movement. The film
  touched on the fact that men do get the worst end of the stick in family court.
  While at the same time also stating, from someone from the feminist camp, that
  you should talk to the other person before engaging in sex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Which you should fully discuss with the person, that you are about to have intimate
  time with, what might happen if a pregnancy occurs. If two people of the opposite
  gender have sex they should honestly have discussed that fact. Since having sex,
  even when using protection, has a very real possibly of producing offspring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Red Pill highlights the fact that both genders do have problems with abuse
  towards them. That sexual or verbal abuse can happen to someone regardless of gender.
  Each time it showed stats though it showed it affects more women.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The thing is though that doesn&#39;t make Men any less valuable or needing help.
  It also doesn&#39;t mean women are any less the victims of these tragic abuse stories.
  All it means is that we should keep all this in mind when we hear about abuse
  stories regardless of gender. If a guy comes forward and says he&#39;s been abused
  by a female then he should have his voice heard. Just like we should listen to
  women if the same thing happens to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I think that to solve some of these issues and get rid of some of the tensions
  between the genders we just need to communicate more. Maybe make a woman prove
  the person she claims is the father is the father before applying for welfare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It&#39;s difficult to discuss these sorts of issues because both sides make good,
  or least half decent, arguments. As both genders can&#39;t possibly imagine what
  life is like in the other&#39;s shoes, so to speak. We can&#39;t possibly fully understand
  how to actually solve these problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway, those are some of my thoughts, I hope I brought something new to the table.
  Let me know what you think there in the comments below. I look forward to hearing
  from everyone. I tend to try to stay as centrist as I can on most issues.
  So until the next one have a great day! :)
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changes in 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is the first post I made on my site in 2017. First off I would like to say hello. Second, there are some things I need to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new year brings about people wanting to make changes usually for the better. This year is no different and I plan on making the most of this year. I’ve already begun my new year’s resolutions and writing more is one of them. Doesn’t matter what I am writing about I just want to write more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also resolved to make more vlogs on YouTube which I’ve started doing. I plan on posting them here perhaps with a full blog post. I figure that will help with exposure. My desire with making vlogs is to try to entertain and maybe inform. I suppose the same thing with my writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout last year I started learning animation and drawing more too. I also began thinking about starting a comic. Which I don’t know if I’ll do that or not but if I do I’ll post it here. I plan on continuing to get better at drawing and animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also continue working on this site and adding new features to it. Hopefully get a portfolio done for potential clients to look at. Whoa, it seems I’ve put a lot on my plate but maybe if I stick to it and put the time in I can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a few job applications in and hope to do some traveling this year. The traveling will give the opportunity to blog about said traveling and get plenty of pictures and video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to keep up with my blog post you can subscribe to the newsletter or the RSS feed. Maybe both? Either way, you’ll get new posts when I put them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and if you have any big plans or small plans let me know what they are in the comments below. I look forward to reading and conversing with you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Am I Voting For?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every 4 years we here in America get to decide who we want to represent us as a nation and every 4 years there’s always a group of people who is disgusted and a group who is delighted. I will preface this by saying whoever is elected I will gladly call my president even if they are not the man or the woman I voted for because that is what America is all about. I will, however, say that this is the election that we as the American people have the greatest chance to change how our politics are played out. We for the first time in decades can actually work more towards a 3 or more party system and buck the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we have a guy like Donald J. Trump who is bent on showing that he is always right no matter what. He will flat out lie even when faced with the truth. On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton who literally wants a war with Russia by controlling air space in Syria. There is another option in Gary Johnson who, while may not 100% perfect, but he at least understands that the country needs people to live with their own decisions. He has shown that he knows how to govern by leaving his state of New Mexico with a surplus and using his governor veto power to it’s fullest. Also since he’s not part of the two major parties and takes money from the people voting for him he’s actually beholden to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to answer the question in case it wasn’t already answered I will be voting for Gary Johnson because I agree more with the fiscally conservative side of him. The personal responsibility that he believes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve read my thoughts or more of a rant what are your thoughts or if I may who will you be supporting and why?&lt;/p&gt;
